    question: "What types of painting services do you offer?",
    answer: "We offer a wide range of painting services including interior and exterior residential painting, commercial painting, color consultation, cabinet refinishing, and deck staining."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical painting project take?",
    answer: "The duration of a project depends on its size and complexity. A standard interior room usually takes 1-2 days, while an exterior project for an average-sized home might take 3-5 days. We'll provide a more accurate timeline during our initial consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide free estimates?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer free, no-obligation estimates for all our painting services. Contact us to schedule an on-site evaluation and detailed quote."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of paint do you use?",
    answer: "We use high-quality, durable paints from trusted brands like Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore. We also offer eco-friendly and low-VOC options for environmentally conscious customers."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your painters licensed and insured?",
    answer: "Absolutely. All our painters are fully licensed, bonded, and insured. We prioritize the safety of our team and your property throughout the painting process."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the color consultation work?",
    answer: "Take the guesswork out of choosing the right hue. Our Color to GoÂ® paint samples are great for giving you an idea of how a color looks and feels in your space throughout the day. Each sample comes in a quart-sized container that holds enough paint for creating test swatches so you can choose your final color with confidence."
